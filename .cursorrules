# memctx Project Rules

## Commit Messages
- Short, 1-2 sentences max
- Start with capital letter
- No prefixes (no feat:, chore:, fix:, etc.)
- Like a human would write at 11pm

## Code Quality
- No over-commenting — code explains itself
- No unnecessary interfaces — concrete types until abstraction is needed
- Real error messages with context
- Consistent style — gofmt, short variable names, early returns
- No god functions — small, focused
- No LLM tells (generic names, boilerplate-heavy, over-engineered)

## Project Scope (1-week MVP)
- CLI only, no HTTP server
- 3 commands: upload, prime, list
- SQLite + sqlite-vec + Ollama
- No Docker for MVP
- Flat file structure

## Review Style
- User reviews high-level only
- LLM drives implementation
- Iterate fast
